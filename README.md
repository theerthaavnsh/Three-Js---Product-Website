<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project is an AI-powered 3D T-Shirt Design website built using React.js and Three.js. The website allows users to customize T-Shirt designs by changing colors, adding logos, and generating logos using AI. The 3D rendering is done using the Three.js library, while the UI and interactivity are implemented using React.js.</p>

  <h3>Component Descriptions</h3>

  <h4>ColorPicker.js</h4>
This component displays a color picker UI for selecting the color of the T-Shirt. It emits an event when the color is changed.

<h4>LogoEditor.js</h4>
This component allows users to add logos to the T-Shirt design. It provides an interface to upload a custom logo image or generate a logo using AI. The selected logo is applied to the T-Shirt preview.
  
  <h4>TShirtPreview.js</h4>
This component renders a 3D preview of the T-Shirt design using Three.js. It receives props for the color and logo to display.

<h4>tshirt.js</h4>
This module defines the T-Shirt model using Three.js. It loads the 3D model, applies materials and textures based on the color and logo, and provides functions to update the design.

<h4>aiService.js</h4>
This service handles AI-related functionalities, such as generating logos using AI algorithms. It communicates with the AI backend API.

 <h2>App Flow</h2>
The App component initializes the state for the T-Shirt color and logo.<br>
The ColorPicker component allows the user to select a color and emits an event when the color is changed.<br>
The LogoEditor component provides options to upload a custom logo image or generate a logo using AI. It updates the selected logo in the state.<br>
The TShirtPreview component receives the color and logo from the state and renders a 3D preview of the T-Shirt design.<br>
When the user changes the color or logo, the TShirtPreview component updates accordingly.<br>
   
   <h2>API Integration</h2>
This project integrates with the OpenAI API to generate logos using AI algorithms. The aiService.js module handles the API communication. You need to have an OpenAI API key to utilize the API.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
Before integrating with the OpenAI API, make sure you have the following:

OpenAI API key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI (https://www.openai.com) by creating an account and subscribing to their API service.
Configuration
In the aiService.js module, provide your OpenAI API key and configure the API endpoint.

   <h2>Deployment</h2>
To deploy the website, you can use a hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. Build the project using npm run build, and deploy the generated build files to your hosting service.
